        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page!
            My name is Courtney Wilkins and I am an IT Instructor here at Per Scholas at our Columbus, OH site.
            I have been an Instructor here for three years. I have taught multiple IT/Network Support courses and I will soon be instructing Columbus' very first Software Engineering course for our WISE (Women In Software Engineering) Cohort.
    
            I am a Husband and a Father. I am originally from Houston, Texas and was raised here in Ohio, but you know what as long as I have been here I can honestly say...I am still not used to this bipolar weather.
